# nodejs345
A repo for the node.js lab in modeling and simulation

This lab was extremely interesting because it helped me explore a concept that I am unfamiliar with. I learned how to create a rest api by connecting it to a MySql database. 
I did not run into many problems during this lab because of the well writtin instructions that guided me throughout the process. This program operates by starting the server using 
the command npm start in the command line. Then you can go to your web browser and type in http://localhost:3002/handles/USERNAME while replacing the username with the name of a 
user your are interested in examining.
